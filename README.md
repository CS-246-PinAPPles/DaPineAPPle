App for Pineapple Grill (Rexburg)

We will be creating a Mobile Application for the Pineapple Grill Restaurant here in Rexburg Idaho. What Eleena Danielson, the sponsor expects of us, is that we build an application that people will want to check regularly and be engaged with. She wants an application that will have their menu and that will also advertise special deals throughout the month. She also wants a secret menu only for the people that follow them. This way, the customers will also be eligible to redeem coupons and birthday deals. The application will display their menu and their secret menu with pictures and have an easy to use interface. We also will make the application take orders online and have it send them the orders to their web application so they can prepare it for the customer for carryouts. For our stretch challenge part, we will attempt to have the app take payments from the customers.

Requirements:
The mobile application will feature diverse customer solutions for the Pineapple grill restaurant in Rexburg. The app will advertise several different deals throughout the month and will have their menu with description. This way, the customers will also be eligible to redeem coupons and birthday deals. A secret menu will also be available for special customers. The app will also allow online ordering for carryouts and will send them the orders to their web application so they can prepare the orders for the customers.

Stretch:
We’d like the app to handle online payments for the carryout orders. They are already using an Anovia Point system, and we’d like adapt a third party application payment system to sync with their current one.
